"mRNAs identified in Ito et. al and analyzed by Pearson correlation: column headers show the transcript codes as identified by Ito et al. (Transcript accession); the names of the proteins as seen in Uniprot database (Protein name); gene names as seen in the Cyanobase (Gene names); the Uniprot accession numbers of all proteins (Uniprot Accession); the log2-mean-ratio normalized retrieved from GEO (GSE14225) from each time-point X (hours in LL) (LL.X); the Pearson correlation value (Pearson); the p-value for the significance of the Pearson correlation (p-value); the cluster number corresponding to each significant protein (Cluster nr); categorization of the protein corresponding to this mRNA, as cyclic (TRUE) and not-cyclic (FALSE), as determined by the Pearson correlation (Cyclic protein); the subjective phase, light (L) or dark (D), at which the mRNA profile shows a maximum abundance (Peak phase (subjective)); the phase, light (L) or dark (D), at which the protein profile shows a maximum abundance (Peak phase protein); the relationship between the mRNA peak phase and the protein peak phase, being in-phase (in), out of phase (out) or anti-phase (out (anti)); the delay between the maximum abundance observed at the mRNA level comparing to the maximum abundance at the protein level (delay (h)) (average delays account for different delays between the 2 days); the functional category at which the protein belongs to, based on the Cyanobase (Function category); the pathway to which the protein belongs, according to KEGG (KEGG); and the biological process in which the protein is involved, according to Gene Ontology (GO_BP).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,(av) average delay based on 2
