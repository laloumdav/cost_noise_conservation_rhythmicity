"Proteins identified in the 48h time-course experiment, using TMT 6-plex labeling: column headers show the Uniprot accession numbers of all proteins (Uniprot Accession); the names of the proteins as seen in Uniprot database (Protein name); the common gene names (gene names); gene names as seen in the Cyanobase (http://genome.microbedb.jp/cyanobase/) (Gene names (Synpcc7942 only); the number of spectrum to peptide matches of each protein for the whole 48h experiment (Total PSMs); the theoretical molecular weight (MW (kDa)); the abundance factor calculated by dividing the number of PSMs by the molecular weight (Abund factor); the relative abundance factor calculated by diving the abundance factor for the sum of all abundance factors (Rel abund); the total number of protein copies analyzed in one sample (Prot copy nrs), as calculated by multiplying the relative abundance factor for the amount of protein material used in the 48h experiment, dividing by the molecular weight and multiplying for the avogadro number; the number of protein copies analyzed in one cell, as calculated by dividing the protein copy numbers for the number of cells used in the 48h experiment (Prot copies/cell); the number of peptides per 12h experiment, one protein was identified with (Unique peptides); number of spectra per 12h experiment, one protein was identified with (Unique spectra); the percentage of which we were able to identify in a protein (Coverage(%)); the normalized protein ratio in a certain time-point X (X hours LD); the number of spectra used for the ratio calculation (Quant spectra); the variance between the ratios of the spectra used for quantification (Variance X hours LD); categorization of significant (TRUE) and non-significant (FALSE) proteins, as determined by the inter quartile range analysis (Significant); the cluster number corresponding to each significant protein (Cluster nr);categorization of cyclic (TRUE) and not-cyclic (FALSE) proteins, as determined by the Pearson correlation (Cyclic); the Pearson correlation value (Pearson); the p-value for the significance of the Pearson correlation (p-value); and the phase, light (L) or dark (D), at which the protein profile shows a maximum abundance (Peak phase).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
